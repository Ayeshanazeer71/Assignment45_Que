// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.



// Array of magician names
const magicians: string[] = ["David Copperfield", "Houdini", "Penn & Teller"];

// Function to print each magician's name
function showMagicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (const magician of magicians) {
        console.log(magician);
    }
}

// Function to add "the Great" to each magician's name
function makeGreat(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (let i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = `The Great ${magicians[i]}`;
    }
}

// Calling makeGreat to modify the array
makeGreat(magicians);
